# IIDS Flask Cookiecutter

This template is intended as a jumping-off point for IIDS flask projects, or for more specialized templates.

## Usage

This is intended to be used with the github "Use this template" button, rather than a fork.

## Features

Here's a rough wishlist for a feature-complete flask cookiecutter:

- [x] Flask App quick setup
- [x] Static page serving
- [x] Compiled SCSS
- [x] Optional Progressive Web Application serving
- [ ] Offline PWA Behavior
- [x] Automatic, versioned API documentation/specifications and interface
- [x] Deployable Containerfile with Guincorn WSGI Host
- [ ] Automatic test deployment
- [ ] Automatic live deployment
- [ ] Database connection template
- [ ] Secrets management

## Structure

This app is designed to build Flask APIs, with an optional light frontend. Frontends requiring interactivity or extensibility should use a UI focussed cookiecutter, such as our Vue/Quasar cookiecutter, to serve the frontend.

APIs are stored in the `app/api/` directory, and accessed at a subdomain endpoint with version string such as `/example/1`. A user interface for the docs is hosted within that path, for example at `/example/1/docs`, autogenerated from the API comments and specification.

## Install

This package intends use of `uv` as its build system and package manager, but should be pip-compatible.

After installing `uv` from its documentation, run

```
uv sync
```

to install all relevant dev dependencies.

## Run

To run the project as a developer, run:

```bash
uv run flask --app project_name run --debug
```

To run the project as a standalone server, run:

```bash
gunicorn
```

To run the project in a container, after installing docker, run:

```bash
docker build -t project_name -f Containerfile .
docker run -d --name project_name -p 8005:8000 project_name
python -m webbrowser http://localhost:8005
```

And to delete, run:

```bash
docker stop project_name
docker container rm project_name
docker image rm project_name
```
