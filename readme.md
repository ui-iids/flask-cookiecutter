# IIDS Flask Cookiecutter

This template is intended as a jumping-off point for IIDS flask projects, or for more specialized templates.

To use it, click the "Use Template" button on Github.

## Structure

This app is designed to build Flask APIs, with an optional light frontend. Frontends requiring interactivity or extensibility should use a UI focussed cookiecutter, such as our Vue/Quasar cookiecutter, to serve the frontend.

APIs are stored in the `app/api/` directory, and accessed at a subdomain endpoint with version string such as `/example/1`. A user interface for the docs is hosted within that path, for example at `/example/1/docs/ui`, autogenerated from the API comments and specification.
